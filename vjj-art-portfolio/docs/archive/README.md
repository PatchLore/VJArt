# Archived Documentation

This folder contains outdated documentation that describes features or implementations that don't exist in the current static Next.js portfolio app.

## Why These Files Were Archived

The current app is a **static Next.js 16 portfolio** with:
- No database, Prisma, or backend
- No authentication or admin panel
- No API routes
- No blog system
- Simple mailto contact form (not FormSpree)
- Uses `app/` directory structure (not `src/app/`)

## Archived Files

### BLOG-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md
Describes a markdown-based blog system that was never implemented. The current app has no blog functionality.

### VJ-ART-ENHANCEMENT-PLAN.md
Comprehensive plan describing many unimplemented features including blog, database, admin panel, e-commerce, etc.

### IMPROVEMENTS-SUMMARY.md
Describes FormSpree integration and features for an old HTML version (`veronica-portfolio.html`). The current app uses a simple mailto contact form.

### NEXT-STEPS.md
Instructions for setting up FormSpree for the old HTML version. Not applicable to the current Next.js app.

### VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT-FIX.md
Describes Prisma and database setup that doesn't exist in the current static app.

### VERCEL-CONFIGURATION.md
Mentions database setup and `src/` structure that doesn't match the current app (which uses `app/`).

### TYPESCRIPT-AUDIT-REPORT.md
References `src/` structure, admin pages, NextAuth API routes, and database features that don't exist in the current static app.

### COLOR-PALETTE-STANDARDIZATION.md
References `src/` structure and components that don't exist. Color palette info may still be useful, but file paths are outdated.
