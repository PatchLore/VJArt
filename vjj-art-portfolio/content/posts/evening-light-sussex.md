There's something magical about painting in the evening light. The way the sun dips below the horizon and casts those long, golden shadows across the fields—it's a moment that demands to be captured.

## Finding the Perfect Spot

I'd been scouting locations in West Sussex for weeks, looking for that perfect combination of composition and light. When I found this spot overlooking the rolling hills, I knew it was the one. The way the trees framed the distant landscape, and how the evening light caught the edges of the clouds—it was perfect.

## Working Against Time

Plein air painting is always a race against time, but evening sessions are particularly challenging. The light changes so quickly, shifting from warm gold to cool blue in what feels like minutes. I had to work fast, blocking in the major shapes first, then refining the details as the light settled.

## The Challenge of Fading Light

As the sun disappeared, I found myself squinting at my palette, trying to match the colors I was seeing. The shadows grew longer, and the colors became more saturated. It's in these moments that you really learn to trust your instincts and paint what you feel, not just what you see.

## A Moment Captured

This painting represents about two hours of work, but it captures a moment that lasted maybe twenty minutes—that perfect window when everything aligns. The golden light, the quiet of the evening, the sense of peace that comes with watching the day end.

I'm particularly pleased with how the light plays across the foreground, and the way the distant hills fade into the sky. It's these subtle transitions that make landscape painting so rewarding.

## What's Next

I'm planning to return to this spot in different seasons to see how the light changes. There's something special about revisiting a place you've painted before—you see it with new eyes each time.
