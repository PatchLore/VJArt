Venice in the early morning is a different city entirely. The crowds haven't arrived yet, the water is still, and the light has that soft, hazy quality that makes everything feel like a dream.

## An Early Start

I woke before dawn to catch the sunrise over the lagoon. The air was cool and still, and the only sounds were the gentle lapping of water against the canal walls and the distant call of seagulls. Setting up my easel on a quiet spot near the water's edge, I prepared to capture this fleeting moment.

## The Challenge of Water

Painting water is always a challenge—it's constantly moving, reflecting, changing. But in the early morning calm, the lagoon was almost mirror-like, reflecting the soft colors of the sky above. I focused on capturing those reflections, the way the light scattered across the surface, creating patterns of gold and blue.

## Working with Limited Time

Sunrise painting sessions are intense. The light changes so rapidly, and you have to work quickly to capture the essence of the moment. I blocked in the major shapes first—the sky, the water, the distant buildings—then worked on the details as the light stabilized.

## The Magic of Morning Light

There's something special about morning light. It's softer than evening light, more diffused, and it has a quality that's hard to describe but impossible to miss. The way it breaks through the morning haze, scattering across the water—it's one of those moments that reminds you why you paint.

## A Memory Preserved

This painting is more than just a landscape—it's a memory of a perfect morning in Venice, of the quiet before the city wakes, of the way the light transformed everything it touched. It's these moments that make travel painting so rewarding.
