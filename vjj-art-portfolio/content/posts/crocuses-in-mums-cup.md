Sometimes the most meaningful paintings come from the simplest subjects. This still life started with a cup of tea and a handful of crocuses from the garden.

## The Inspiration

My mother's teacup has always been special to me. It's one of those everyday objects that carries so much meaning—the floral pattern, the way it fits in your hands, the memories it holds. When the crocuses bloomed in the garden, I knew immediately what I wanted to paint.

## Setting Up the Composition

Arranging a still life is like telling a story. Every element matters—the angle of the cup, the way the flowers fall, the light that catches the rim. I spent time moving things around, trying different angles, until everything felt just right.

## The Delicate Details

Painting flowers requires patience. Each petal, each curve, each subtle variation in color—they all matter. I worked slowly, building up the layers, trying to capture the delicate quality of the crocuses and the warmth of the teacup.

## A Personal Piece

This painting is deeply personal. It's about memory, about family, about the small moments that matter. The way the flowers bloom from the cup, the soft light that illuminates the scene—it all speaks to something tender and meaningful.

## The Joy of Still Life

Still life painting gives you time. Unlike plein air work, where you're racing against changing light, you can take your time, refine the details, really get to know your subject. There's something meditative about it, something calming.

This piece reminds me why I paint—not just to capture what I see, but to preserve what I feel, to hold onto moments that matter.
