excerpt: Some thoughts on working outside, observing light, and responding to the landscape as it changes.

Painting outdoors has always felt like a conversation rather than a plan.

The light never stays still, and neither does the mood of a place. A cloud passes, the wind shifts, a colour that felt certain moments ago quietly disappears. Working outside means accepting that uncertainty and responding to it rather than fighting it.

I'm drawn to painting on location because it asks for attention. You have to really look — at the relationship between shapes, at the way colour changes across distance, at what matters and what can be left out. There isn't time for overthinking. Decisions are made instinctively, and often imperfectly, but they carry something honest about the moment.

Some days the painting comes together easily. Other days it resists. I've learned that both outcomes are useful. Even unfinished or awkward work teaches you something about light, structure, or your own habits as a painter.

Many of the pieces on this site begin this way — outdoors, in changing conditions, with a focus on atmosphere rather than detail. Back in the studio, those studies often become references for larger works, but they retain the immediacy of that first encounter.

This blog will be a place to share occasional thoughts like these: about painting, places, and the quiet moments that often inspire the work.
