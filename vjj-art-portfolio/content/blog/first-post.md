excerpt: "A few thoughts on painting outdoors and the way light transforms familiar places throughout the day."

There's something about working directly from the landscape that changes how I see. When you're standing there with your easel, the light shifts almost imperceptibly, and what seemed ordinary becomes filled with colour and movement.

I find myself drawn back to the same places—a bend in the river, a particular stand of trees—not because they're spectacular, but because each visit reveals something different. The same spot in morning mist has little to do with the same spot in late afternoon sun, yet they share a quiet continuity that only painting seems to capture.

These days I try to get out at least once a week, even if it's just for an hour. The process itself, of mixing colours and seeing how they sit next to each other, of building a composition from what's actually in front of me—it's a kind of meditation. And when I look back at these paintings months later, I'm not just seeing the scene, but remembering the weather, the light, the quiet moments of observation.
